## üîß Technical Features

### Validation & Type Safety
- **Runtime validation** using Zod schemas
- **TypeScript integration** with inferred types
- **Business rule enforcement** at the model level
- **Error handling** with descriptive messages

### Performance Optimizations
- **Strategic indexes** utilized for all searches
- **Batch operations** for relationship updates
- **Efficient queries** with proper includes
- **Distance calculations** optimized with Haversine formula

### Business Logic Implementation
- **Automatic slug generation** with uniqueness guarantees
- **Follower count management** with atomic updates
- **Date consistency validation** for events
- **Duplicate prevention** across all models
- **Relationship integrity** with proper cascading

### Data Integrity
- **Referential integrity** enforced at database level
- **Business rules** validated before operations
- **Transaction management** for complex operations
- **Cleanup procedures** for data consistency

## üöÄ Key Business Logic Features

### User Management
```typescript
// Automatic preference creation
const user = await Models.User.create({
  email: "user@example.com",
  name: "John Doe"
})
// User preferences automatically created with sensible defaults
```

### Smart Event Creation
```typescript
// Comprehensive validation and relationship management
const event = await Models.Event.create({
  name: "Blues Weekend",
  startDate: new Date('2024-06-01'),
  endDate: new Date('2024-06-03'),
  venueId: venue.id,
  teachers: [teacher1.id, teacher2.id],
  musicians: [musician1.id],
  prices: [
    { type: 'EARLY_BIRD', amount: 150, deadline: new Date('2024-05-15') },
    { type: 'REGULAR', amount: 200 }
  ]
})
// All relationships, validations, and slug generation handled automatically
```

### Intelligent Following System
```typescript
// Automatic follower count management
await Models.Following.follow({
  userId: user.id,
  targetType: 'TEACHER',
  targetId: teacher.id
})
// Teacher follower count automatically incremented
```

### Advanced Search Capabilities
```typescript
// Multi-criteria event search with pagination
const results = await Models.Event.search({
  query: "blues workshop",
  location: { city: "San Francisco", radius: 50 },
  teachers: [teacherId],
  priceRange: { min: 100, max: 300 }
}, { page: 1, limit: 20 })
```
